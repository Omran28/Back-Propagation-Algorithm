# Multi-layer Perceptron
- Implementation of Multi neurons using Forward and Back Propagation algorithms.
- It adjusts the weights of the network during the backward stage to minimize the difference between predicted and actual output using the gradient descent optimization algorithm. 
- Uses dynamic number of neurons and layers.
